# Bite 125. Get the most recommended books

https://codechalleng.es/bites/125/

The Tim Ferriss Show is full of wisdom and inspiration. It can also quickly fill up your book shelves because a lot of
awesome titles get recommended.

This raises the question: which books to prioritise? We found this list but for some the Top Books (multiple mentions)
might still be a daunting list!

Luckily we are PyBites Ninjas so what if we use some BeautifulSoup to scrape (a static copy of) the site to see which
books get recommended most.

Complete get_top_books below to find the answer. See the docstring for more info and again, we don't use the live page,
we work with this static copy so we can reliably test your code. Keep calm and code in Python!
