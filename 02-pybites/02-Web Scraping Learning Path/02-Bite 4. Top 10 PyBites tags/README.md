# Bite 4. Top 10 PyBites tags

https://codechalleng.es/bites/4/

In this Bite you will find the top ten tags found in the PyBites blog XML feed (e.g. Python, Flask, Django, learning).

The tests for this Bite expect you to use collections.Counter and we loaded a static copy of our XML feed so we can
predictably test your code. The PyBites tags will need to be parsed from the XML tags within each (Hint: you don't need
an XML parser for this task).

What are PyBites people most passionate about? Look at the tests and you'll know the answer. Then write your solution to
make the tests pass.

Keep calm and code in Python!
