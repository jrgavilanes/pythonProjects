Up to this point anyone can modify food entries in the food log API, for any user!

That is not desired and in this Bite we will have you lock down the API.

You'll work through the OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens guide adding all the pieces to
effectively make the API secure using using JWT tokens and secure password hashing. You'll use FastAPI's elegant
Depends() to lock down the endpoints that were copied over from a previous Bite.

Good luck!

This Bite concludes the FastAPI learning path. Stay tuned for an SQLModel learning path where we build a similar API but
using an ORM / database for persistence.

If you have any feedback on this learning path use the feedback form upon completing any of the Bites or hit us up
directly on Slack.
